### Descreption:
It is a web application which built to show the high 20 rated shows based on TMDB rating.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Structure:
The system is made of 2 lists , one for all shows and the other one is for favorates shows.
The "Home" page contains the nav bar wich includes both of the lists and "About" component, then the shows' posters and titles are listed and at the bottom we have thee footer which contains the "TMDB" & my copyrights and my "Linkedin" page for contacts.
"My Favorate" page has the same structure of the home page with different functionality for the buttons , the first button shall remove a selected show from the list, the "Clear" button shall remove all shows from the list.

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Tools & Techneiqes:
- JavaScript
- CSS
- API
- Routers
- React

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Project status:
For now , the application is able to show the high rated shows with poster and title. The user is able to add & remove show from the favorate list , and clear the whole list.

### Future plan:
- User shall be able to add to & remove from "Watch later" list.
- User shall be able to show each show details (e.g. Description , cast and rate).

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Conclusion:
It wasn't easy to start and apply the functions, but it was a great opportunity to get more practice on a new concepts for me. Next project should be way better than this one and more effeicint.
